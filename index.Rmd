This repository has different versions of my resume, with the paged versions created with [`rmarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) + [`pagedown`](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown) (NOTE: for now 1 and 2 only works properly in Chrome, as some aspects of CSS Paged Media are only supported by this browser):

1. [Paged, academic resume](one-column-paged-academic.html)
1. [Paged, 2-column brief resume](two-column-paged-brief.html)
2. [Paged, 1-column resume](one-column-paged.html)
3. [Ordinary scrolling HTML resume](one-column.html)
4. [Ordinary scrolling HTML resume, formatted in the style of an old version of my personal website](website-cv.html)

The resum√©s pull in their content from the 'cv_entries' and 'publications' tabs of [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ta71CAGkcLqm-W1UdVRA_JJSddWV2TsrRZsCnQlmOis/edit?usp=sharing) (which holds most of the content for [my website](https://ulriklyngs.com/)).

To use this for your own CV, download or clone the GitHub repo: https://github.com/ulyngs/pagedown-cv/ 

Here is the original resume layout (made in Microsoft Word) that I wanted to recreate with `pagedown`:
