This repository has three versions of my resume:

1. [Short, 2-page professional resume](professional_cv.html)
2. [Paged full resume](one-column-paged.html)
3. [Ordinary scrolling HTML resume](one-column.html)

The resumés pull in subsets of cv entries that live in two Excel files (one for publications, one for all other cv entries).

These resumés are made with [`pagedown`](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown).
