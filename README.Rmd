# Welcome to `pagedownCV`

This package provides three R Markdown templates for creating a dynamically generated, academic CV, illustrated with my personal resumé.
The package uses [`pagedown`](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown) for the two paged versions.

## Formats
### [Academic CV (paged)](man/figures/README-one-column-academic.pdf)
<embed src="reference/figures/README-one-column-academic.pdf" width="600" height="375" type="application/pdf">
<br>

### [2-column CV (paged)](man/figures/README-two-column.pdf)
<embed src="reference/figures/README-two-column.pdf" width="600" height="375" type="application/pdf">
<br>

### [Website CV (with sidebar and tabsets)](reference/figures/website-cv.html)
<br>

## How do I use it?
Install the package with

```r
remotes::install_github("ulyngs/pagedown-cv")
```

Then, in RStudio, go to File > New File > R Markdown... > From Template \
Then, choose either **Academic CV**, **2-column CV**, or **Website CV**.

Academic CV, and 2-column CV generates a PDF when you knit it (as well as the source HTML) -- the Website CV generates just an HTML file.

Like so:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-1_open_rmd.png")
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-2_select_template.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-3_small_generated.jpg")
```


## A note on page breaks
In both the Academic CV and the 2-column CV, you can write `<br class="pageBreak" />` in your R Markdown source file, which will add a page break at this location.

In the Academic CV, you might find that cell content that's overflowing to the next page gets placed in the wrong column on the subsequent page (I've flagged it in [this issue](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown/issues/299) for `pagedown` --- hopefully there's a solution soon).
If you encounter this, you can work around it by manually inserting a page break in the row before.
There's a convenience function for this, that's described [here](reference/manual_page_break_after_row.html).



## Why?
The [`pagedown`](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown) package lets you output an R Markdown file to paged HTML content which can then be saved as PDF.
This means you can use R Markdown to programmatically pull out content from some spreadsheet with our CV data, output it to a paged format, do the styling with CSS, then save as PDF and/or host it online. Brilliant!

Nick Strayer's excellent [data-driven cv](http://nickstrayer.me/datadrivencv/)) package, as well as the base format for resumés provided by `pagedown` (`pagedown::html_resume`), make this easy to do.

However, their available layouts don'tsuit my taste (especially for an academic CV).

## Where do the layouts come from?
When I designed the Academic CV, I was particularly inspired by the resumés of [Matthew Kay](http://www.mjskay.com/) and [Elena Agapie](https://eagapie.com/pubs/cv.pdf). I use this format for academic purposes.

The two-column one, I originally designed in Microsoft Word, with the intention of using it for brief, professional 2-page resumés where you need to squeeze content into less space. 


## How does it work?
Each resumé is generated by an R Markdown file that pulls in content from the included data files **publications** and **cv_entries**.

These are samples of the corresponding tabs in [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ta71CAGkcLqm-W1UdVRA_JJSddWV2TsrRZsCnQlmOis/edit?usp=sharing), which holds my CV information along with most of the content for [my website](https://ulriklyngs.com/).

Replace these with your own data -- I added [another convenience function](reference/save_gsheet_as_csv.html) that you can use to download data from a google sheet and save it as CSVs locally.
You could, for example, make a copy of my Google sheet, then replace with your own content.

Enjoy!!
